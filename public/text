I need to developing a web-based software application for Bauman Auctions. The program must have a clean, easy-to-use interface. Upon launching, the user is prompted to select a folder. The program then scans that folder and analyzes all image files.

Step 1: Lot Number Detection
The system will examine each image, identifying the lot number. The lot number will be printed on a surface that is approximately 60% white. Once the number is identified, it will be extracted using OCR (Optical Character Recognition) and entered into an Excel spreadsheet as the Lot Number.

Step 2: Image Analysis + Content Generation
For each image following a lot number image, the program will:

Perform a reverse Google image search.

Generate a title for the item (120 characters or fewer).

Create a more detailed description based on search data.

Add both the title and description to the Excel sheet.

Step 3: Pricing Research
The program will search online marketplaces (eBay, Amazon, etc.) for matching or similar items, extract the lowest and highest prices found, and record both in the spreadsheet.

Repeat Process
Once a complete lot (lot number + item images) is processed, the program continues scanning the folder until all images are processed and data is collected.

Spreadsheet Output
All results (Lot Number, Title, Description, Low Price, High Price) are compiled into an Excel spreadsheet for the user.

Web Application + Admin Controls

The platform will be web-based, requiring users to log in with a username and password. Admin will have full control over:

User account creation

Subscription plans

Pricing

Monthly scan/image limits

There will be 4 subscription plans, each with customizable pricing and picture scan limits. The admin dashboard must allow for editing plan names, limits, pricing, and user access.
